# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

**Sorting Algorithms Visualizer** is a web-based tool that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and others, to help users understand how these algorithms work through animation.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**: Choose from different sorting algorithms and watch them sort a list of numbers step by step.
- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Generate random arrays of varying sizes and see how different algorithms perform on them.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Allows users to interact with the visualizer, adjusting the speed and size of the array for a personalized experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the basic structure and layout of the visualizer.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the interface and animating the sorting process.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the sorting algorithms and controlling the animations.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Open the project**:
   - Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the visualizer.

3. **Use the visualizer**:
   - Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown.
   - Adjust the array size and speed as desired.
   - Click "Generate" to start the sorting animation.

## Algorithms Visualized

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and merges them back together.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each element into its correct position.

## How It Works

1. **Select Algorithm**: Choose the sorting algorithm you wish to visualize from the dropdown menu.
2. **Generate Array**: Click "Generate" to create a random array of numbers.
3. **Visualize Sorting**: The algorithm will sort the array step by step, with each step being animated for easy visualization.
4. **Adjust Settings**: You can change the array size and speed to see how different algorithms perform with different data.
